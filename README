This library was intended to be a kd-tree structure for rust.
It interfaces with the nanoflann library, I ultimately decided that this
library would not be useful for my purposes.
This library could use some more work before it's suitable for public use, such
as supporting the common numerical types in rust & it currently does not have
any support for the rust side of this library.

If you want to do anything with this library, go ahead, I doubt I will be
working on this more in the future.
