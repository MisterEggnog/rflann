This library was intended to be a kd-tree structure for rust.
It interfaces with the nanoflann library, I ultimately decided that this
library would not be useful for my purposes.
This library could use some more work before it's suitable for use, such
as supporting the common numerical types in rust & it currently does not have
any support for the rust side of this library.

If you want to do anything with this library, go ahead, as it will need a lot
of changes before it works to my satisfaction.
With other projects & school, I don't know when or if I can get back to this.

If you need a space partitioning data structure in rust, the rstar or kdtree
crate may be more useful to you.
